# Image Classifier With ImageAI (Python 3)
This is a simple tutorial on how to use some neural networks to classify images. The algorithms chosen are those contained in the ImageAI package for Python 3 (SqueezeNet, ResNet, InceptionV3 and DenseNet). It is very simple to implement and very easy to understand. 

I strongly recommend using Google Colab to run these scripts, since neural networks require a lot of computing and memory capacity. The best thing is thata GColab is free!! You can find a tutorial here: https://medium.com/deep-learning-turkey/google-colab-free-gpu-tutorial-e113627b9f5d

As you can read on http://imageai.org/ IMAGEAI "is an easy to use Computer Vision Python library that empowers developers to easily integrate state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence features into their new and existing applications and systems. It is used by thousands of developers, students, researchers, tutors and experts in corporate organizations around the world." It can be used for image recognition (this case), video detection and object detection.

For image recognition (or classification, it's the same) ImageAI offers these Neural Network (ANN) algorithms:
